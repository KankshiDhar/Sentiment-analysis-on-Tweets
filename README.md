# Sentiment-analysis-on-Tweets

The sentiment analysis tool used in this assignment was VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner). 
The algorithm used in VADER is sensitive to both polarity of positive or negative words and the strength of emotion used in a sentence
specifically trained on social media. VADER text sentiment analysis uses a human-centric approach, combining qualitative analysis 
and empirical validation by using human raters implying it is an example of a lexical approach of sentiment analysis.
